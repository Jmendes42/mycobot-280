With this project I expect to get a deeper understanding of the following concepts: <br>
 - Applied linear algebra
 - Geometry foundations
 - Reference frames and transformations
 - Forward kinematics
 - Inverted kinematics
 - Jacobian and differential kinematics
 - Trajectories and motion planning
